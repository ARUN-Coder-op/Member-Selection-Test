## Problem Story: The Quest for Summation

Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled amidst lush greenery and rolling hills, there lived a young mathematician named Alex. Alex was known throughout the village for his unparalleled love for numbers and his insatiable curiosity for solving mathematical puzzles.

One sunny afternoon, as Alex was strolling through the village square, he stumbled upon an ancient scroll tucked away in the corner of the village library. The scroll was adorned with cryptic symbols and intricate patterns, hinting at the presence of a hidden mathematical treasure.

Intrigued by the mysterious scroll, Alex embarked on a quest to unravel its secrets. As he deciphered the ancient text, he uncovered a fascinating mathematical problem that had perplexed scholars for generations: the quest to find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 below a given limit, denoted by the letter N.

Determined to crack the code and unlock the hidden treasure, Alex delved deep into the realm of numbers, exploring various algorithms and strategies to tackle the problem at hand. With each passing day, his passion for numbers grew stronger, driving him to push the boundaries of mathematical exploration.

Through tireless experimentation and unwavering dedication, Alex finally succeeded in devising an efficient code to compute the sum of all such numbers below the given limit N. His discovery marked a triumph not only for himself but for the entire village, as it unlocked a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom hidden within the realms of mathematics.

And so, the legend of Alex the Mathematician and his quest for summation became a cherished tale passed down through the generations, inspiring future mathematicians to embrace the beauty and power of numbers in their quest for knowledge and enlightenment.

## Problem Statement

Your task is to develop an efficient code to print all the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5 below a given limit N.

### Input

The input consists of a single integer N, representing the upper limit.

### Output

Print the sum of all numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 below the given limit N.

### Constraints

$$
1 \leq N \leq 10^6
$$

## Example

### Input:
```
N = 20
```

### Output:
```
60
```

## Notes

In the example above, the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 below the limit 20 are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18. Their sum is 60.
